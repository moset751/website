Also exhibited is Manhattan Suicide Addict, a recent video projection in which the artist herself is seen performing a songshe composed, while an animated slideshow of selected artworks moves behind her. Drawing its title from her first semiautobiographical novel published in 1978, the video was produced for the 17th Biennale of Sydney in 2010. It is installed in the  <a href="Page8.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">gallery</a> flanked by two twelve-foot tall mirrors, further enhancing the video’s psychedelic effects as well as infinitely reflecting
the image of the artist and her artworks. Along with the <a href="Page6.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">mirrored</a> infinity rooms, it exemplifies the vitality of Kusama’s optical environments, which become hypnotic and self-referential, merging concepts of flatness and depth, presence and absence, transience and permanence, and finiteness and infinity.
