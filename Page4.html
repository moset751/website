For the exhibition, Kusama has created a series of brightly colored, square-format paintings, the majority of which measure over <a href="Page3.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">six</a> feet. Part of a recent body of work, they allude to universal spheres or basic life forms and highlight her unique amalgamation of representational and non-representational subject matter. Whereas Everything About My Love depicts a sea of biomorphic shapes,some personified with faces, <a href="Page5.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">The</a> Way to My Love and Searching for Love present innumerous eyes, varying in size and proximity, bisected by arteries filled with round, colorful forms. Rows of human profiles are repeated to rhythmic effect in such works as Women in the Memories and Pensive Night. Vibrant, animated, and intense, the paintingstranscend their medium to introduce their own pictorial logic, which appears both contemporary and universal.
