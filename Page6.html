 Another <a href="Page7.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">mirrored</a> infinity room, Love Is Calling, stands as one of Kusama’s most immersive, kaleidoscopic environments to date. It is composed of a darkened, mirrored <a href="Page5.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">room</a> illuminated by inflatable, tentacle-like forms—covered in the artist’s characteristic polka dots—that extend from the floor and ceiling, gradually changing colors. A sound recording of Kusama reciting a love poem in Japanese plays continuously. The work was shown earlier this year in Tokyo as part of a group exhibition 
commemorating the Mori Art Museum’s 10th anniversary. The gallery’s presentation marks its 
Unite States debut.
