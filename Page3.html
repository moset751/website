The exhibition’s title, I Who Have Arrived In Heaven, reflects the
artist’s long-standing interest in cosmic realms and resonates with
the autobiographical element that runs through her oeuvre. 
The recent and new <a href="Page2.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">works</a> on view at the gallery continue her innovative
exploration of form, content, and space, while at the same time 
presenting a link to her artistic production from the past <a href="Page4.html"style="cursor: url('cursor4.png'),crosshair">six</a> decades.
